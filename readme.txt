Inital commit

Things to do:

-Find Tutorials on creation of a simple app.
	>Preferably something with a general layout,
	then move to more advanced with login screen/other pages connected 
	to the main index.
		*Android should have some tutorials on website, but youtube
		is also a possibility*


-Look into database systems, find which will be the easiest/cheaper (for now).
	>Mongo Databasing
	>Kintone Databasing
	>RackSpace
	*these are just from a google search and need more research to 
	determine which should be used*

-(once database is up and running) connect application, and work on website
	>With database in place, we will need to learn connection from the app to
	the database for users to be able to connect properly. Once connected, we should
	aim to work on a website. 
	*Also continue to work on APP updates*
